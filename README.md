Node.js 

This repository documents a series of structured exercises completed as part of my continuous development in backend engineering with Node.js.
Each file represents a focused practical covering different aspects of Node.js from working with core modules to building simple servers and using Express.

Overview

The repository demonstrates:

- Modular programming using Node’s built-in module system
- Asynchronous programming and callback handling
- File system manipulation (reading, writing, renaming, and deleting files)
- Event-driven architecture using the events module
- HTTP server creation and serving static content
- Stream operations and the use of pipe() for data handling
- Command-line interaction with the readline module
- Basic Express applications for routing and middleware
- Package management using npm

Description

- modules.js Demonstrates how custom modules are created and imported.
- eventemitter.js Shows implementation of custom events using Node’s EventEmitter.
- readlinemodule.js Handles user input from the terminal using readline.
- filesystemmodulePT2.js Performs file operations with the fs module.
- httpserver.js Creates a simple HTTP server responding to client requests.
- httpstaticfile.js Extends the HTTP server to serve static files.
- pipechain.js Demonstrates reading and writing data streams with piping.
- express.js Introduces Express.js for simplified server creation.
- express2.js Builds on Express fundamentals, adding routes and middleware.
- npminstall.js Covers installing and using npm packages.
- mystream.js Explores streams for efficient data processing.

Objective

The primary aim of this repository is to consolidate key backend concepts in Node.js through hands-on implementation.
It serves as a foundation for building scalable backend systems and deploying them in DevOps-oriented environments.
